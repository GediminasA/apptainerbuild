.SH NAME
.PP
apptainer-capability - Manage Linux capabilities for users and groups


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBapptainer capability\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Capabilities allow you to have fine grained control over the permissions that
  your containers need to run.

.PP
NOTE: capability add/drop commands require root to run. Granting capabilities
  to users allows them to escalate privilege inside the container and will
  likely give them a route to privilege escalation on the host system as well.
  Do not add capabilities to users who should not have root on the host system.


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB-h\fP, \fB--help\fP[=false]
	help for capability


.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
.RS

.nf

  All group commands have their own help output:

  $ apptainer help capability add
  $ apptainer capability add --help

.fi
.RE
